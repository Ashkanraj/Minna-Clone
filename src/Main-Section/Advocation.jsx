          The first organization that we are partnering with is Help Refugees
          and Choose Love. Help Refugees has over 70 projects in Europe and the
          Middle East that provide emergency aid and long term solutions for
          people seeking refuge. Choose Love is the worldâ€™s first e-commerce
          store where all products purchased are donated directly to refugees in
          need.

        <p className="text-lg">
          As we grow, we plan to diversify the use of funds to non-profits
          focused on helping those communities still fighting for equality.
